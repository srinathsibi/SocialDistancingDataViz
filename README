This is the data visualization script for the social distancing project. The script uses map plotting tools from the geoplot and geopandas libraries. The links are here:

1. https://geopandas.org/install.html
2. https://residentmario.github.io/geoplot/installation.html

To get started, I recommend not using the conda instructions for installation, but instead the pip instructions. I used python 3.6.9 and pip3 to install all the relevant packages (of which there are many; e.g. Fiona, cartopy, descartes, etc.)

Please contact me for questions.
